#Design a Python class for a Bank Account.
#The constructor should take parameters for the account holder's name and initial balance. 
#Implement private attributes for these parameters. 
#Create methods to deposit and withdraw money from the account, as well as to display the account's balance.

#Instantiate more than one object from the class, and show suitable testing.
