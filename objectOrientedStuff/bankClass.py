#Create a Python class for a Bank. 
#Implement a constructor that initializes an empty list to store bank accounts. 
#Create methods to add a new account to the bank, find an account by account number, deposit money into an account, withdraw money from an account, and display all accounts' information. 
#Instantiate more than one object from the class, and show suitable testing.
